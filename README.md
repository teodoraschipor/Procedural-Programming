# Procedural-Programming
This project is developed using C. The main idea is that a person A sends to a person B an image I, which is being encrypted by A using an encryption algorithm. B can decrypt the encrypted image received from A obtaining the initial image I. After that, B processes the image (uses an algorithm which recognises handwritten digits in image I).

Person B then sends to person A the resulting image he encrypts. Person A decrypts the encrypted image received from B and can view the solution, recognition of handwritten digits.
